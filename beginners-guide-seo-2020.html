          SEO sounds like a very technical term if you are a beginner, but if you are
          already into the digital world, you might have started to think of it as a 'set of

        <p id="specialBox">
          "According to
          <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/what-is-seo" target="_blank"

            'SEO is the 'practice of increasing the quantity and quality of
            traffic to your website through organic search engine results.'</b

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation, in which we have to
          update/modify a piece of content(example:- a blog article) in such a
          way, that when our customers or audience will search for something
          related to our content on search engines like Google, it
          will rank higher on the search results page.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <i>Let's say</i> you have a blog on 'Cat Care', where you
          post articles about how to take care of your pet cat, one of which is on the topic of 'How to bathe your cat?'
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
           So, to make it appear higher in the search results when someone searches for an article about this topic, by typing the same or a similar term on Google, you apply SEO strategies.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        You want your
          article to reach more and more people (<b><i>Quantity</i></b
          >), but also want to reach only those people who are interested in
          this question (<b><i>Quality</i></b
          >).

        <p>
          <i>In simple language</i>, Search Engine is a program(or website) which
          provides answers to our question when we tell them what we want. The
          question you enter in the search engine box is called <b>Query</b>.

        <p>Examples:- Google, Yahoo! Search, Bing.</p>

          It's nice to have a basic understanding of how search engines
          work before going forward.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The process is <b><i>Crawl -> Index -> Rank</i></b>. We will take Google as
          our main search engine throughout this blog.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Crawl:</b> First, the bots(short for robots) of Google, also
              known as spiders or crawlers, will try to find every page on the
              internet.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Index:</b> Second, they will scan the content of the webpage, gather information on what the page is about and how good the content is and
              store that information in a database.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Rank:</b> Third, they will rank them on the results page whenever
              you type something inside Google's search box and press <kbd>enter</kbd>.

        <br />
        <p>
          You might have heard of SEM also, which stands for Search Engine
          Marketing, which is different from SEO. Let's find out.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In SEM, we pay money to Google to rank our site on the top of the search
          results. It comes under PAID Advertising. These links are
          differentiable by an <span id="ad">AD</span> tag.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But in SEO, the ranking is ORGANIC meaning its free. Our rank only
          depends on our quality of your content.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Digital Marketers loves SEO?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          With the rise of social media and people spending more time on them,
          there are still so many reasons why digital marketers say that
          <b>'SEO is Important'</b>. Few are these:-
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Free: </b>You only need to invest some of your time, or you can hire someone to do this work, but you do not
              need to pay money to anyone to be on the first page of google results. In a time when social media's organic reach is
              decreasing, this free form of marketing is still considered to be
              one of the best.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Sustainable: </b>It means your efforts will last longer. If
              your content is good, it will keep showing up in the results until Google finds
              some better alternative. Whereas in social media, even
              a viral post gets no reach after some days.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Intent-based: </b> People search for something only when
              they need it. So, your content will be infront of only those people who want a service that your business offers. It is like sending
              your sales-person to a potential customer's home, ONLY when he or she wants to meet him.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />

        <!-- Types of SEO -->
        <h2>Objective of SEO and its Types</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The aim of doing SEO or Optimising your content is to <b><i>make
          Google and your audience HAPPY</i></b>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Primarily, you have to (i) Make it easy for Google to understand your
          content, (ii) Provide Useful content to the audience and (iii) Develop
          Trust among your niche's audience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>There are <b>3 types </b>of SEO:-</p>

        <h2>On-Page SEO + Tips</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          First, understand this:-
          any page on the internet is not a document or .docx file made using Microsoft Word, <b>it is a Webpage created with coding languages like HTML,
            CSS and JavaScript.</b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you are reading this on a desktop/laptop, press <kbd>Ctrl + U</kbd> and
          you will see the HTML code for this page, which is actually what the
          bots of Google actually see.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>So, your job is to make it easier for these bots to understand what is present on the page and on-page SEO deals with this issue. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Here are a few easy tips for performing on-page SEO on your site:-</p>
        <br />
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Keyword Research: </b>A keyword is a word that people use inside
              their search queries. For example, if you want to find keywords
              for your article on 'Favourite Food for Cats', the keywords will be 'cat food',
              'food for cats', 'favourite cat foods' and so on.
            </p>

              So before writing an article, you have to find these <i>'special'</i> words to be included in our content. These keywords are
              used by bots to analyse the page's content.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There are many tools available to find these keywords according to your requirements. After finding them, analyse
              their search volume, clicks they are getting and traffic potential to decide
              whether you should use them or not.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Short keywords(like 'cat food') usually have high search volume but they
              are also highly competitive. So, 
              <b><i>start with Long-tail keywords</i></b>, like 'food for small
              cats', which have low search volume but less competition as well.
            </p>
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Use Synonyms: </b>Using the same keyword many times in the
              article is known as 'Keyword Stuffing'. It is a bad practice in
              SEO and Google might penalise you for that.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              So to be safe, you can use
              synonyms of the keywords. Google is intelligent enough to understand
              them. An example will be using 'recipes', 'meal' instead of 'food'.
            </p>
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Search Intent Keywords:</b> Use those keywords which people
              actually use in their searches, called 'search intent' keywords. You can
              find them from the suggestions you get when you start typing
              something in 'google search box' and on also 'searches related to'
              section on the results page.
            </p>
            <br />
            <img
              src="./assets/images/search-intent-keyword-suggestions.png"
              alt="Google search suggestion box and related searches"
            />
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Title Tag and Meta description: </b> Title of your article is
              the text of the links shown in the google search results. It is
              used by Google to find out the purpose of the page.
              The Description is a summary of the web page's content.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src="./assets/images/title-tag-meta-description.png" alt="title tag and meta description html code">
            <br />
            <p>
              So, it should be the first step always to use the keywords in
              these two places. They are HTML elements, but if you are using
              Wordpress, you will have a separate section to fill these values.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Custom URL: </b>Your URL of the webpage should also contain
              these keywords, like you can see the url of this page is
              <i>'/beginners-guide-seo-2020.html'</i>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Click-worthy Title: </b>The title of the page is not only seen
              by Google, but also by the users. So, create a title which users would love
              to click. Add a modifier like 'best', 'top', a number like '7
              best tips...' or something to make it interesting for the users.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              According to one of the new Google algorithm update, if your link shows up in
              search results but not many people click on it, this will result in
              less CTR(click-through rate), which will signal Google that your link is not performing good which will affect your ranking.
            </p>
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Heading Tags: </b>There are six heading tags in HTML from h1 to
              h6, but only h1, h2 and h3 tags are used more frequently.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Use h1 for main-heading, h2 for sub-headings and h3 to highlight meaningful sub-sections.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Alt tag: </b>The alt tag gives a small description of
              the image. Google can't read what's in the image (but very
              soon it will with machine learning), so, this tag helps google bots to
              learn more about it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Decrease Bounce Rate: </b>Bounce rate is the rate by which
              users leave your article or say hit the back button very early.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Nowadays, people start by scanning the article to find the valuable
              content they need. So, include something appealing in the
              beginning, like this page had a poll to engage readers in the first few search-intent-keyword-suggestions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Lengthy Article: </b> It is common to think that since most people are so busy, they will not
              read long articles, so why to waste time in length. But many studies suggest that long articles are prefered by Google and users since they
              provide more content to be scanned by the bots and more content for the users in one place. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              So,
              <b><i>Write Longer Content if possible.</i></b>
            </p>

          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Increase Dwell Time: </b>Dwell time is the average time users spend on
              your content. If people spend more time with yours, google thinks it is more
              valuable than others and will eventually make your content reach the top of the
              list.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Some simple tips to increase it will be to avoid using long paragraphs(write in
              short 2-3 lines), include stats and infographics since people get
              amazed by them, also add different types of media pieces like video, a quiz or a
              game that users will spend time with and this will eventually make them stay longer on your website.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p><b>Simple English: </b>It is a myth that you need to be good at English grammar to write articles, but it is an incorrect statement because most people are not English scholars.</p>
            <br>
              <p>Avoid using big or uncommon words and write in a simple day-to-day language to make it easy to understand.</p>

        <!-- Technical SEO -->
        <h2>Technical SEO Tips</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Technical SEO means optimising the website's technical aspects for making it more accessible to Google bots and us, the users. It mainly concerns with making the webpage load faster, making it easier for bots to crawl and index and also gives a better user experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Below are some simple tips to make your site technically stronger:-  </p>
        <br>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p><b>Good Hosting for Speed: </b>Web Hosting means renting a computer which runs 24x7 to store your website. Every website needs to have a web hosting to make the site live.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But hosting charges are different for different sites, low for sites where fewer visitors come and more for more visitors. So, if your website is getting good traffic,  you should immediately upgrade your hosting plan according to the amount of traffic you are receiving.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Many studies have shown that users are impatient and can't wait for even 3 seconds to load. <b>So, make the site load as fast as you can</b>.</p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p><b>Responsive Design: </b>It is a term from the website-development field, which means that your website should be adaptable to all types of screens- laptop, tablet or mobile.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p> Now, everybody is using mobile to do their work so if your site is not customisable for mobile phones, users will immediately bounce back and google will decrease your ranking. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Also, Google's recent updates <b><i>favour websites which are performing better on small screens</i></b>.</p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p><b>Compress Images: </b>It means lowering the size of the images since they take  most of the time to load. It will decrease the loading time, and as I said, users hate to wait. There are many free tools to do this, so don't forget to do this.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p><b>SSL Certificate: </b>It means encrypting all of the user's data which they user will enter on your site for security. Google doesn't want to rank sites which are not safe, so include an SSL certificate on your site now. You can get it from your web hosting.</p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p><b>Add More & More Links: </b>Every single webpage should contain as many links as possible, either internal or external links. It signals that your content is researched and is a more connected part of the internet. </p>
            <br>
            <p>But only add links to related content or important parts of website, do not just add links for the sake of it.</p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p><b>Browser Caching: </b>It is the technique by which we can tell user's browsers that they can store some data of the webpage permanently on the browser's storage so that it will not be required to fetch this data next time the user load's the same website.</p>

        <!-- Off Page SEO -->
        <h2>Off-Page SEO & Tips</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Off-page SEO includes all activities done to promote the webpage. Here, we try to get more and more external links linking back to our page, which indicates Google algorithm that your content is more trustable. These are called <b><i>Backlinks</i></b>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These backlinks have one more benefit as well. If you get a link, not only google trusts you more but also you will get traffic from these sources.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Below are few tips to get these links:- </p>
        <br>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p><b>Create Shareworthy content:- </b> If your content is good you do not need to ask anyone for a backlink, they will provide it since they will like to link your content to theirs. So, create content that others will love to share.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Few examples will be if you have done some research and generated some data/statistics which other articles want to link in their content or create an infographic which every other blogger wants to include in their article.</p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p><b>Guest Posting: </b>It is the process where other websites want some content(maybe because they don't have so much resources to do so) which you can provide and in return, they will give you a backlink.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is a bit difficult to find this type of opportunity but if you get a chance of backlinking from a big authority site, do it as soon as possible. </p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p><b>Social Media Shares: </b>Initially, getting a backlink from other sites is not so easy, so, it is better to share the content on your social accounts.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You can also ask other players in the niche to take look at your content which they may like and share it. Also, add social share button on your sites to make it easy for users to share content on their social accounts.</p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p><b>Forum Links: </b>There are many forums on the internet where your content can be the answer to people's questions. So, try to search in these forums and share your page links with a well-written answer.</p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p> <b>via Press: </b> Many people in the press/news media are always looking for something new to write about and if your content can solve this problem, grab this chance quickly. </p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p><b>Partner-Content: </b>It is the latest strategy in the market where what you only have to do is to ask other bloggers/influencers in your domain to provide some info or comment, which you will add in your content.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That way, all the people who have contributed to your content will share your content and you will get good traffic and backlinks as well.</p>

          <h2>Trends for SEO in 2020</h2>
          <br>
          <img src="./assets/images/person-searching-on-google.jpg" alt="searching on google">
          <br>
          <p>Now, let's talk about the trends which will rule the SEO world this year and beyond. It is better to be the first to apply these new techniques before it becomes common, and everyone takes advantage of them.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Here I mention some important trends to learn right now:- </p>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><b>Google's E-A-T: </b>EAT is the latest update in google's ranking algorithm. It stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. What it practically means is that 'expert content' is more preferred, creating authority is more necessary now, with better user experience for building trust is now essential.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Since it is an important update, I will include a simple video explanation but in nutshell, you have to do these three things from now:- (i) Only write about things you are actually an expert in, (ii) Build a niche-specific site and stick to it and (iii) Remove any content which might contain false information.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In short, <b>Build a Brand</b>.</p>
              <br>
              <div class="video-responsive">

              </div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <p><b>No-Click Searches: </b> Next-time whenever you search something, look at the results page. The top is filled with 2-4 ads, there might be a local businesses section, similar questions section, a feature snippet or a combination of all of them. So, all the top-space of the page is taken up by something other than organic search results. </p>
              <br>
              <p>Also, some queries are now directly answered by Google, like searching 'When is Holi?'. </p>
              <br>
              <img src="./assets/images/when-is-holi-zero-click-search-example.png" alt="when is holi zero click search example">
              <br>
              <p>What I want to say is that chances of users actually clicking on the links are getting lower, so, now your first reaction should be to get that feature snippet.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <p><b>Rich Snippets: </b>Also known as feature snippets, it is a small selected content from a blog which will be shown directly on the results page to answer the user query. Since this will usually be the first answer to the user's query, these have the maximum probability of getting clicked.</p>
              <br>
              <img src="./assets/images/rich-feature-snippet.png" alt="rich feature snippet example">
              <br>
              <p>There are many techniques available to get your content to get displayed in these snippets, so try to apply them from now.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <p><b>Schema Markup: </b>Simple words, It is additional content that will be shown on the results page with your link, like a rating on that content by the users. Here is an example:- </p>
              <br>
              <img src="./assets/images/schema-markup-example.png" alt="Schema Markup Example">
              <br>
              <p>Users love to get some insight about the link they are going to click on, and these type of unique indicators will increase the chances of clicks.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
